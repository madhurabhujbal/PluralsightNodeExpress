Shivaji has been a legendary figure in the Indian history.<br /><br />Shivaji was one of the major influences on the revival of nationalism and Hindu culture during a period when centuries of rule by Muslim invaders had induced a condition of apathy and indifference in the people.<br /><br />Over the years, many legends have been added to Shivaji’s life, and it is hard to filter out these embellishments and just focus on the facts.<br /><br />The author has done his best to build this book just on facts. And the facts alone are interesting enough to highlight the achievements of this legendary king.<br /><br />Shivaji was a man who built a dynasty starting from nothing. His motivations were always immense pride in his culture and love for his motherland. However, he was not a bigot and treated all his subjects equally well, irrespective of their religion and other divisions. His battles were mostly with Muslim rulers, but he never showed any animosity towards the Muslim inhabitants of his kingdom.<br /><br />The author has presented Shivaji as he really was, with no embellishments. Shivaji was a dynamic leader, a warrior, and a nobleman. He was religious without being fanatic, he was a believer, but not superstitious, he was courageous but not foolish. He was a visionary who dreamt of building a Hindu kingdom in a region that was surrounded by Muslim dynasties. Yet, he was extremely practical.<br /><br />Shivaji was a courageous warrior and a great tactician. At the same time, he was also a very good administrator and the kingdom he was building up became stronger under his rule. He suffered many defeats too, but he never gave up his vision, and ultimately, he did succeed in making his dream a reality.<br /><br />The author, in this book, has captured all the different facets of Shivaji’s personality that contributed towards this legacy, and thus gives the reader a sense of involvement in the events taking place in the story.","average_rating":"4.50","num_pages":"1190","format":"Hardcover","edition_information":"","ratings_count":"3281","text_reviews_count":"131","url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6727757","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6727757","authors":{"author":{"id":"3028220","name":"रणजित देसाई","role":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3028220._","average_rating":"4.33","ratings_count":"10299","text_reviews_count":"405"}}}

Drawing from real-life characters and incidents, these sketches are as varied as people can be and quite interesting.<br /><br />The stories in Vyakti Aani Vyalli were written over a period of more than 20 years, from 1944 to 1968. Of the 20 stories in the book, the one about Bhaiyya Nagpurkar was the earliest one written by the author. The lead character is a Brahmin by birth, but he is often mistaken for a Muslim for various reasons. He is wealthy man with a bad reputation, but he admires Gandhiji, the Father of Nation. He even avoids drinking alcohol on the days when Mahatma is fasting.<br /><br />There are a lot of other varied sketches in this book. Narayan helps in arranging marriages and also ensures that the functions go smoothly. The author reveals an interesting side of Narayan.<br /><br />There is Parophari Gampu who would go out of the way to help people, and then there is the washer-man Namu Parit. The washer-man breaks buttons and uses his customers clothes on himself, and never delivers on time. He has every other evil habit imaginable but has no idea that the things he do are wrong.<br /><br />There is also a school boy named Sakharam Gatne, who speaks classical Marathi and is addicted to books. Lakhu Risbud, who is another interesting character, is a disillusioned writer who wanted to change the world with his pen, but ends up working as a sub-editor in some obscure magazine.<br /><br />The list goes on, with a fine variety of characters reflecting the ironies of life. Vyakti Aani Vyalli earned the writer a Sahitya Akademi Award.","average_rating":"4.44","num_pages":"","format":"","edition_information":"","ratings_count":"78","text_reviews_count":"3","url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43623339-vyakti-ani-valli","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43623339-vyakti-ani-valli","authors":{"author":{"id":"4905266","name":"पु. ल. देशपांडे","role":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4905266._","average_rating":"4.26","ratings_count":"15541","text_reviews_count":"360"}}}
